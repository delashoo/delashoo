I am in love with decentralized technologies and always find a workaround for problems by building decentralized solutions.

Solidity and Python are my go-to languages, Truffle & Brownie make my list of frameworks. Working my way up the Foundry framework too.

######  The few things I do in this space include;
* Exploring the limitless possibilities of `blockchain` ðŸŒŒ technology

* **Forging** ðŸ”¥ the `god-demons` of ~Solidity~ , *repairing* *broken* *ones* *too*.

* ðŸ’¡ Turning code into innovation, one line at a time ðŸ’».
