In love with decentralized technologies, the best solutions are decentralized.

ðŸŒ± Solidity and Python are my go-to languages, I know some JS ofc, Foundry + Brownie make into my list of frameworks.  

######  The few things I do in this space include;
* Exploring the limitless possibilities of `blockchain` ðŸŒŒ technology

* **Forging** ðŸ”¥ the `god-demons` of ~Solidity~ , *repairing* *broken* *ones* *too*.

* ðŸ’¡ Turning code into solution, one line at a time ðŸ’».
Why do you think decntralization existed in the first place?
