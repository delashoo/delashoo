# Hello there!
## I am delashoo, a random tinkerer.
I am currently learning a lot of tech stacks, that also means I'm open to collaborating on any project that interests me.
However, my allegiance lies with the Decentralized environment and web3 development.
Building layer 1 solutions logically is better than incorporating layer 2 solutions for scalability.
