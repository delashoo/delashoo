##### Who am I? 

#### My name is Xamdimek 

A random tinkerer && Ethereum aficionado with 3 years of experience in web3. I have deep affection for decentralized technologies and enjoy spending my time exploring the limitless possibilities of the blockchain technology ðŸ’¡.

Turning code into solutions one line at a time ðŸ’».

 ðŸ”¥ **Forging** the `god-demons` of ~Solidity~ WHILE *fixing* *broken* *ones* .

Why do you think decentralization existed in the first place tho?

I write tech articles, use this link (https://samdimek.hashnode.dev/ "delashoo's Blog") to read something today.
